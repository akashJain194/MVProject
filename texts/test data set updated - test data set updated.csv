"Anyone else having a problem with the battery tanking?  I’ve covered all the bases. Brightness down, location services only while using apps, no background app refresh, etc. my battery is consistently going down 50% in 5 hours for the past 24 hours that I’ve tested it. Regular use, no difference between sleep & wake, it’s losing the same amount. Ideas??","
Are you restoring your iPhone from an iCloud backup? If so, that is almost definitely the reason why your battery is draining. Well, that combined with new phone fever. Whenever I first get my new iPhone it expends a ton of battery life downloading all of my apps and photo thumbnails from iCloud. Also, when we get our new phones, we tend to use them much more than we normally would. The combination of these two things has a big negative impact on battery life. I would wait one week when everything is loaded and you are back to normal use. If you are still seeing the quick drain, call Apple Support.
"
,"There is definitely something wrong. My iPhone 11 Pro Max has been off the charger for 6 hours so far today and it still has 81% battery. At this rate, it will last up to 30 hours. Keep in mind that I am home so it has been on WiFi all day, which is much more efficient than cellular.
 
Go to Settings: Battery
View your usage for the last 24 hours
See if there are particular hours that stand out
Look at the apps and activity % to see which apps are sucking down the battery
 
Let me know what you find.
 
I have seen a situation like this before and doing a full reset of the phone fixed it. Not sure if we are there yet with your phone so you should check the list above.
 
Best,
Frank
"
,"Let's make sure we are talking about the same thing when I say full reset and you say hard reset. I am not referring to the force quite (volume up, volume down, hold power until Apple logo appears). I am referring to Settings: General: Reset: Erase All Content and Settings.
 
I feel that there is some bug in your system that is draining the battery.
"
,"I am having the same issue with my 11 Pro, the phone it self gets super hot when i am doing minimal things like talking on the phone for a few minutes or just on facebook. I woke up at 7 am this morning and it was 10 am that my battery was already at 20% thats just from me taking 2 phone calls and listening to Spotify while working out. I upgraded from the 7+, i contacted support they advised me to do a restore iphone in ITUNES on my computer. I am very skeptical right now, i have been googling the crap out of this issue so i hope this works. I love the phone but if its the pro and the pro max i might just down grade to the 11 cause my wife is having the time of her life with it."
,"Are you saying you do not charge the phone while you sleep? If so, even if it is on the low end at 75%, that means that your charge will a full day. If it is only down to 85%, then it will likely last beyond your next bedtime. However, if you do not charge it while you sleep, you must charge it at some point during the day, which would extend it even further.
 
I am sorry that some of you are having battery issues. I typically leave my phone on a Qi charging stand while in my office, but I just went to teach a class so it has been off of the charger for about 100 minutes and the battery is still at 100%. The battery on my iPhone 11 Pro Max has been nothing short of extraordinary. If you are having really bad battery life, I would seek help from Apple.
"
,"
I would follow that advice. That sounds like a major software bug. I would do the restore from iTunes and test it stock before restoring from iCloud.
"
,"Let me give you some information for comparison to see if this helps. My iPhone 11 Pro Max today.
 
Removed from the Qi charger in my office at 4:27 PM
Was on WiFi
Taught class
Drove home while listening to a podcast (10 minute drive)
At home
I am on WiFi as well.
Screen on 5h 31m
Screen off 1h 38m
Played Grindstone (30% of my total battery usage) Note that it did not drain my battery by 30%. It was just 30% of the total usage this evening. I like to play while watching the news.
Listened to podcasts (17% of my total battery usage).
The rest is made up with a mix of different things.
 
The Battery settings also notes that my phone was at 100% until 6:30 (a full 2 hours after removing it from the charger).
 
So I have been off of the charger for 7.5 hours now and my battery is at 74%.  At this rate it should last for 30 hours under the same usage load. This is typical for what I have been seeing over the 10 days since I got the phone.
 
What does your battery drainage curve look like over 24 hours?
 
One more question because I have to know: why don't you charge your phone while you are sleeping? If you are at all worried about battery life, I am dying to know why you don't take the 6+ hours per day when you are absolutely not using your phone to charge it.
"
,"What am I missing here? If you do not charge your phone fully, you are not going to get good battery life. I do not understand the logic of not charging your phone at night."
,"I kinda actually figured it out. All I had to do was reset my phone lol. Maybe some kind of soft ware issue. I assumed that when I installed iOS 13.1, that it was gonna reset but yeah. Battery lasts forever now! lol. Thanks for the help!"
,"Do you have it set to keep original copies on your phone? That would make it take longer. However, Photos always runs in the background for a decent amount of time when I get a new phone. Now I have almost 50,000 photos and videos so it is more understandable in my case. How many days has this been going on?"
,I would keep it on a charger and on WiFi whenever you can during the first few days.
,"iOS 13 has a new feature. You will find it under Settings > Battery > Battery Health
The feature is called Optimized Battery Charging and it is made to solve the exact issue that you are referring to.
Just to double-check, you are saying that during the night you could see your battery drain 30% but when you tapped on the areas that covered those drops, there was nothing listed as using the battery power?
Is your iPhone on WiFi overnight or cellular only? Because if you truly had no apps running in the background, the only other thing I can think of is that you have your phone in an area of the house where there is a terrible signal. Struggling to maintain a wireless connection (especially if it is cellular) will wear a battery down faster than just about anything.

"my wife and me have put our brand new iphones 11 inside our pocket pants and both screens get scratched the second day of use (mines right in the selfie camera, apple says “without mal function”...). Has someone experimented somethg similar? We are really dissapointed, apple only cares if you have bought “apple care”....we cant use the screen without a protection: worst screen ever...._","Not to diminish what any of you are experiencing but every year the same things seem to be echoed. There will be people that say their phone shows scratches/nicks inexplicably and that there must be a defect because previous models did it do it. And that may be true for them but there is always at least one thread posted echoing the same complaint. Only thing that can be suggested besides the obvious  (even though not loved by those that hate doing it...that’s using a screen protector of some sort and/or a case) would be to report it to Apple and determine if it’s really a defect or just bad luck. For those that are near an Apple store and feel like it’s a defect should go there and let them see the device and observe how the screen looks and then while there replicate the issue. If the screen is truly faulty it should be easy to make a new scratch/smudge/scrap appear if the only thing that caused it before was putting it into an empty pocket for example. Makes it difficult for them to not be willing to replace the device if you can show the issue happens. Probably not what anyone wants to hear but being able to show evidence absolutely helps more than showing damage after the fact and wanting them to believe the damage happened out of nowhere. Not saying any of you are lying but imagine how many people do or would claim scratches they know they created by being careless occurred out of nowhere.
 
I would be frustrated if it happened to me no doubt but I’ve been very fortunate. Never had a scratched screen or cracks on any iPhone. Yes I’ve dropped them countless times, tossed them with abandon, etc but I’ve also always used a screen protector (always cheap ones) and a case...usually an Otterbox Strada but I do so because I know that I always plan to sell my device and by taking these measures my iPhones have always looked like new making get top dollar (far more than any of these trade in offers ever give). Usually the first week or two has me using a cheap case to hold me over while I wait for the Strada or this time the Nomad folio to arrive while keeping a trimmed down version of the plastic that comes on the iPhone in place until my cheap $5.99 3 pack arrives from Amazon in place to keep the screen pretty safe. I say all of this to say that I have been pretty lucky to not have an issue on any of my iPhones or the others in my home (iPhone 11 product red and 2 iPhone 11 pro gold)...although I did have a mini scare when I dropped a thick heavy palette corner down directly on my iPhone 11 pro Max gouging the plastic and making me terrified that I had taken a chunk out of the screen. Thankfully no damage to the screen. No scratch or anything. That was pure luck because it absolutely should have had some significant damage if not a full fledge shatter. Definitely made me think long and hard about adding AppleCare+ immediately _
 
Hope you all are able to get some assistance with the scratches but if not...consider a screen protector at minimum. The cheap ones I use don’t alter the feel of the screen at all. Again, I get these not so much for concerns about cracks but to ensure the screen doesn’t get surface scratches solely for preservation of resell value.
Now for those with the smudge/fingerprint looking issue...that’s absolutely odd based on how it looks. Definitely suggest they also go to Apple if possible (or unfortunately deal with the process those of us that don’t have an Apple store near by have to...calling in and perhaps having to mail it in to them if pictures of the issue aren’t something they can diagnose). If you purchased from a local retailer perhaps visit them and see what they are willing to do...although they may be less inclined to swap out if it’s the scratches because they may automatically say they think it was your fault. Don’t let that dissuade you if you feel strongly about it. Just know that the retailers may be less inclined to investigate further which means you need to push the issue with Apple directly).
 
Ultimately I’m a strong believer in fighting for what you think needs to be corrected so I suggest you go to where the correction would have to occur. Apple. The forums are great for users to help each other when they can but if you have a problem the company needs to be alerted to and address...you won’t get anywhere until you actually reach out to them and do from there

"
,"Basic scratch resistance is fundamental to a touch screen display. I have never put any screen protector on my iPhones, the same way I never did with the windscreen on my car. Because they never needed it. This early behaviour in these iPhones 11 is a bit alarming. This discussion thread here is to discover whether and if this is a common problem (isolated, or not) and what is the solution. Hiding the flaw with screen protector is not a solution, but a choice one can make after the fact."
,"So again...your options are to use a screen protector (which if you don’t want to then that’s your choice but to dismiss it because you don’t like the idea isn’t getting you anywhere. I never said anyone HAD to do so...it was a suggestion and I explained why I choose to do so. If you don’t want to do it then that’s perfectly fine but don’t turn it into a ploy to hide a flaw that has not yet been established to be a flaw in the screen but could very well be something that just happened. These glass screens were never advertised as scratch proof so to act like a scratch occurring on day 1 or day 1000 is promised to not occur if you opt to not use anything is presumptuous and incorrect. Annoying absolutely but not impossible)....or go to Apple and determine if the screen is indeed defective due to a manufacturing issue. Not that difficult to understand. As far as it being a widespread issue...unless you start seeing it in the national news there is no real way to determine that based on online thread posts. We represent a very small percentage of people carrying these devices and unfortunately most don’t turn to online forums for assistance (I kind of wish they did) and the ones that do more often than not do so in order to discuss a problem....which makes it appear that a problem is affecting the masses when in reality it’s probably affecting less than 1%). So ultimately, the only way to make sure that’s proper accounting of a possible issue is made everyone that is having the issue and feel confident that the issue is the fault of poor materials and not the risk of a glass screen coming in contact with anything that can cause a scratch (dirt particles like sand which we all know are strong enough to scratch anything, keys, anything abrasive, etc...). Showing Apple in person how simple it is to scratch your screen in person in ways that they say it should not (and no...how long you have owned it doesn’t determine when it should scratch. No more than you buying a new car and it getting scratched the first day you own it is a manufacturer defect because you just spent tens of thousands on it and you only just bought it. Stuff happens and it’s frustrating but it doesn’t automatically mean defect). If the issue is common and a defect by all means go to Apple in droves. Make sure they know it’s going on. But...if it’s like it is every release where this same exact type of thread happens with the same exact type of “it scratches too easy and it never happened in the previous models” complaints then know that it actually has happened in previous models but until now you may have been the lucky ones to not have to post about it happening to you. And...at the end of the day it’s glass. Yes, on a very expensive item that that they advertise as “the toughest glass in any smartphone, front and back” but at no point claims it won’t scratch or guarantees it won’t do so within a certain timeframe. Sorry if you don’t hearing that but it’s the truth. Again frustrating but a chance you take if your choice is not want to use a screen protector or anything."
,If you are near an Apple Store please please please visit them if you haven’t (not sure if you went in or called them). Especially if you think the issue occurred without reasonable cause. Show them in person what happened and try to replicate it causing another scratch in front of them (but before you do that part ask to speak with a manager and ask them if I can show you how easy a new scratch will appear while we are face to face is it something you will genuinely try to resolve). It’s far easier to just say “nothing we can do” if the customer is not face to face and they are only going by what you say happened. If there is an issue that Apple needs to address then those having the issue have to press Apple to seek resolution unless they can explain clearly why it’s not an issue or defect. Worst case scenario they still determine that it’s not a defect but a case of glass getting a scratch from something introduced to it as can happen. Best case...they see a pattern of abnormalities that they realize they need to address.
,Just a few after a super quick search. Point being that this isn’t a new complaint. So I don’t know if it’s fair to think these new releases are more prone than previous releases. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately if you haven’t experienced it every time you got a new iPhone) it seems to happen at random. Still report it to Apple directly. Perhaps it’s a coating issue for a relatively small percentage...perhaps for some it’s scratches that were there prior to unboxing that went unnoticed (sadly it’s probably difficult to prove that unless you buy in-store and are able to see it before you leave)...perhaps it’s things that you never considered causing it like rivets on jeans pockets...or a micro abrasive coming in contact that you didn’t know was in your pocket like sand or something else equally tiny but capable of causing a scratch. But report it to Apple even if you think they won’t help. Do it in person. Do it via the website feedback form. Do it via contacting Apple Support.
,"the truth is, while Gorilla Glass is focusing on minimizing cracking, that makes the screen more prone to scratches. If they focused more on minimizing scratches, then the chance of breakage increases. (Look up the science.) it’s a complex algorithm that glass makers have to fine tune, to seek that balance between minimizing chances of cracking vs scratch resistance."
,"I have a dime-sized smudge that has appeared today along with a few smaller scratches so I have an appointment at the Apple store tomorrow. This is a major inconvenience for me given the timing, but I want to get there ASAP."
,"like many others in the thread I have not dropped or been rough on my phone. This smudge seems to be a problem with the coating, you can feel it with your finger and when running water on the phone the smudge doesn’t repel water at all. It also looks like the smudge is under the glass so likely some kind of reflection from the coating not being right."
,"Ok guys (and girls) try reading this article 
 
It discusses how yes, this glass can still scratch. It’s scratch resistant not scratch proof. And your pass iPhones got scratches too even if you say you didn’t experience them. Plenty of people (I use plenty loosely because our forum and others represent a small number of customers) have had complaints in the past. Not just with iPhones either. Please do as I and someone else that did it mentioned. Actually submit your complaints to Apple. Can’t say this enough. That or return your phones if using a screen protector violates your idea of being too much work for the price you pay. Amazon has cheap ones from numerous brands. Super shields has cheap ones (the non glass ones of if you prefer the tempered glass). $6.49 for a 6 pack of front only ($5.99 on Amazon) or $6.49 for 3 front and 3 back. I don’t suggest that pack for the pro model because the textured glass on the back won’t allow a screen protector to stick (tempered might though). This info is for those that want to get a protector not meant to make you feel like you must. Unless a recall happens and gets labeled scratch gate (has not the previous years and they all had a small percentage complaining of scratches too. Good luck.
"
,everyone in here is aware of inherent scratching and normal wear and tear. Most have acknowledged that this exceeds that. Multiple posts in the same thread along the lines of “every phone scratches” isn’t productive. We are aware. This is not that.
Does anyone face the issue of your iphone 11 heating up fast? I’m worried of having a hardware issue. I don’t mean like really hot but just able to feel some heat from the back of the phone from just using instagram.,If you are concerned make an appointment at an Apple store for help. They can tell you if it's normal.
,"
You will hve to contact apple to check it
 
Hey, I consulted an apple support guy and he told me it’s normal. I also did my research and found out that the problem may be caused by the DARK MODE. If u have it turned on just turn it off and  please let me know if there’s a difference cus there was for me.
"
,I just downloaded the newest 13.1.2 with the new 'dark mode' yesterday afternoon. I immediately notice my phone heating up. I mean really heating up. I am most certain it is the new update with the dark mode. I read your comment about it being in the 'dark mode' that was causing it as I was on hold waiting for Customer Support with AT&T. I hung up and switched my phone back to 'light mode'. It has only be 15 minutes but there is a noticeable cooling down. I guess I will keep it in light mode and or try the auto mode. It is so pretty in dark mode. I hope they fix the bugs quickly.
,"I wanted to by Iphone 11, not pro one. So, in apple store I checked both and compared at least ten of each. All Iphone 11s were heating after using a short while. Even when they were in charge they were warm in button side. After using a short while, I saw mostly they were heating very fast in button side which is very uncomfortable. Also in middle of phone after a while you can feel heating. But Iphone 11 pro with exactly same usage like using an app/camera or game is completely cold. Don't worry that this just your phone problem. But very weird and uncomfortable at all."
,I stopped thinking about 11 one. Pro has no problem.
,"It was because of IOS 13.1.1, after updating to 13.1.2 which is released few days ago the heating problem is fixed, (Iphone 11). I checked again it again in apple store, now heating is normal (a llitle bit more that 11 pro but its normal)."
,I took care of the problem by taking the setting off of dark mode and I placed in auto mode. It really helped a lot. Phone only gets too warm when it changes mode and not hot
,"There is supposed to be a bug fix coming soon but, if you have your phone in dark mode I would change it to auto or light mode for now. "
All am i doing since updating ios 13.1.2 is charging my phone. I am using 6s and it was working fine until i did this update lastnight. Please apple fix this issue as i am losing my patience and might lose trust in apple in future.,"
The following setting changes seem to work for me. Hope that helps you all
disable 'Optimized Battery Charging' in the battery setting
disable most of the location service options as described in <link> 
disable 'Share iPhone Analytics' and 'Share iCloud Analytics' in Privacy setting
TURN ON 'Limit Ad Tracking' in Privacy setting
"
,"
Hi all, I had the same problem with my iPhone SE. After the update I could literally watch the battery charge counting down and also my phone got quite hot. I tried different things (Disabled Location Services - had some impact but not a lot, Disabled optimized charging - nearly no impact, ...) but the only change that really had a great impact for me was disabling the Peak Performance Capability (link).
 
After disabling it, my battery lasts again like before! Hope this maybe also works for others!
"
,You can definitely reduce the symptoms by progressively disabling features but the iphone 7 still manages to drain out with no reported background activity and then fails to recharge (with an apple smart battery). disconnect the case and then a couple reboots and it starts to charge up again. the sudden depletion of power when idle and asleep is strange. and this definitely coincidentally started ios 13.1.x updates.  and it will randomly shutdown even after reaching 100% power...
,Apple had me backup the phone and did a hard restart to recovery phase then do update from my I tunes. after that it reloaded everything back on my phone and so far the battery has been fine. Might be worth trying. they remoted in and my battery was fine.
,"Keeping an eye on these post for a week. Been suffering all that's reported in the previous posts on my iPhone 6s; overheating, major battery loss over 1015 minutes. You name it I've had it.
 
Following couple of call to Apple support, reset phone to bare bones  as new  ststus...but thios loads 13.1.3 - so guess what, same problems. Have done all posted means of reducing battery drain; no change.
 
Went to local Genius Bar today for hardware test. Result? No problems and problem stated to be a software fault... that might or might not be resolved in the near future.  Thanks Apple!!  Even more so as my husband now using his iPhone more  than the usual  very casually for very short periods .  I think you might guess what the outcome was...but, in case you haven't, his iPhone 6s has the same problem.
 
To rub salt in our wounds, while in Curry's looking to source an Android replacement, a lady came in reporting the same problems on her 6s as the reason for now wishing to by an Android replacement.. Then, to increase my aggravation (and ire with Apple) while in the Genius Bar, another lady came in reporting similar problems and the technician (just back from holiday) said that he'd had another report on this issue earlier in the day.  Thanks a lot Apple....NOT! 
 
Please, Apple, resolve asap and let users know there's a problem, what you're doing to fix it and an estimated time for resolution. Management by mushrooming does not work.
"
,"One of the things that it could be related to is network or the at&t carrier.
Call is what drains the battery the most, safari second.
Yesterday I got a notification about carrier update, I just pressed ok. Not sure if this will help but I believe that are other things related for the battery to drain faster with the IOS13.1.3.
I also called apple and they run a remote test on my phone, everything was ok according to the three tests they run.
They suggested me to do a restore which I have done weeks ago but i didn’t fix anything.
I look at the battery chart and activities and it looks fine, I don’t see anything abnormal.
Still not sure what else to do.
Close to tape a battery pack on the back of this phone, really.

How to abbreviate names like  Brendan Julian van Wyk  for writing references in journal papers?

,"The dilemma is quite accentuated since names are unique to every region. The name MOHAMMED EL GAMAL AL SABAH for example could be a poser. In order to standardize the citations, most of the publishing houses, editors and journals clearly specify the style to be followed: APA Fifth, Chicago Fifteenth Edition, ISO 690, MLA Sixth Edition, etc. Incidentally, MS WORD has the facility to automatically stylize the citation depending on the journal/editor's dictum. There are also free software on the net to convert references to citations depending on the style specified.
I found ZOTERO a very useful software, since it takes care of all these issues, allowing me to concentrate on the paper more. It is free.
On a lighter vein, a typical South Indian name like mine, Rajamanickam Srinivasan, invariably gets written as Rajamanickam, S - giving due credit to my father (Rajamanickam) for having groomed me to be an academic !!

Dear Professor:
About surnames getting citations instead of 'first' names, this is very common.
My advisor, (Late) Christopher I. Byrnes (USA), had his papers cited as  C. I. Byrnes  and the co-guide, Prof. Alberto Isidori (Italy), has his papers cited as  A. Isidori .  Among friends' circles, my guide was known as  Chris  & Prof. Isidori is called by his friends as  Alberto .
In my own case, friends call me  Sundar , but my papers are cited as
 S. Vaidyanathan  and my new chaotic systems are now known and cited as  Vaidyanathan systems . This may be a common practice.
Best wishes,
Sundar.
"
,"
Chithan C Kandaswami is absolutely correct in his answer to my query.
A similar name is that of a famous Electrical Engineer - Balthasar van der Pol. While many credit Lorenz for detecting chaos while modelling weather patterns, Henri Poincare and Balths. van der Pol discovered chaos much earlier and they called it as some  irregular noise .  van der Pol also discovered a famous limit cycle, cited in most of the text-books on nonlinear control systems, and it is also a classical example of a Hopf bifurcating system.
Coming to the query & answer, this is how van der Pol's paper (classical one!) is cited by researchers:
van der Pol, B. (1926). On relaxation oscillations. Philosophical Magazine, 6, 978-992.
Why van der Pol chose to publish his paper in a  philosophical  journal may make another question for RG, but as this is a very early work - 1926, I don't know if I'll get many answers to it.

Greetings to you, Dr Vaidyanathan!
Thank you for the very interesting information as well.
Sir C V Raman (Chandra Sekhara Venkata Raman, who was awarded the 1930 Nobel prize for physics, completed his undergraduate program while he was sixteen. His first scientific paper published when he was sixteen (on diffraction bands), incidentally was in the “Philosophical Magazine”, as was his second, on a totally different area of endeavor (a new method that he devised to measure a liquid's surface tension). The Philosophical Magazine was one of the most prestigious scientific journals of that period. Science, in a way, is philosophy even though science is more concerned with the “how of things” whereas the “why” of things in nature appears to more solidly posit in the domain of metaphysics. Asking questions about nature and attempting to glean insights into the nature of things and of natural order are inherent to science (scientific philosophy).
Regards.

Another very interesting journal is   The Philosophical Transactions of The Royal Society  - B Biological Sciences (PHILOS T R SOC ). Philosophical Transactions A is devoted to a specific area of the mathematical, physical and engineering sciences.

Dear Sundar, 
I was sure that as a mathematician you would be following Transactions A. I did not mention what prompted me to send the name of this journal. At one point, I was asking why the Philosophical Transactions of The Royal Society was publishing science articles just as the Philosophical Magazine did. I had mentioned Biological Sciences B first as intriguing interdisciplinary articles appear. I forgot to mention that Transactions A are also of interest to me since they sometimes publish articles relevant to biological sciences (for instance oxygen biology). Thanks very much for your link on  The Royal Society and India . I shall read it.

Which scientific articles should be use for citation in scientific paper?
There are many different articles which gives almost similar result of a particular topic. They might be published in different duration/ national/ type of journal like very high quality or even very low quality journals. In such situation which article we would chose to use while preparing manuscripts for scientific papers?
","You should always cite some key articles in your field and also some newer/newest articles; also, you should cite top authors in your field (including some newer work), usually also some literature review articles and some methodology articles if you use such methods. If you wish to publish your work in top/good journals, then you should certainly also cite articles published in top/good journals in your field as otherwise, your aticle will not be accepted. Also, from the journal's viewpoint it is good if you cite some previous articles published there as this will increase the journal's visibility and shows that your research suits well to that journal but, of course, you should cite such articles only if they are to some extent linked to the content of your article"

Intellectual responsibility is an attitude that you wish to convey to the readers of your research.  Not to cite ALL relevant references would be irresponsible.  Think that some future researcher will criticize you for any omission of references.

I select the ones which are relevant to the topic I am writing about, which I have accessed during the course of preparation of my manuscript. Further I also cite the ones which help me in making the narration of the problem more clear so that those reading it may also refer to the cited literature to ascertain the relevance of the problem being discussed.

,"Beside the many good suggestions given above, I want to emphasis again on citing the references that are directly relevant to your work. You should mention those references which we call them  state of art . This means the recent  publications are preferable.
Also, I must confess some editors insists adding few references from the journal you want to publish your work in. Presumably to get a higher IF!  Under this situation you must compromise and somehow forgot about  Relevancy  .

,"I am not biased based on journal quality or impact factors. If the article is published and is relevant to the research you are doing, you should cite the research in your literature review. The research you do should be de-limited by the questions you are asking and answering."
,"I would cite those papers that are directly and not remotely relevant to my research. I will also cite more recent articles in the area so as to let the readers know that I am aware of what is being done in the field by contemporary researchers. It is also the duty of the researcher concerned that seminal papers--whether old or new--are cited. And, if the choice is between research published in high impact factor and low impact factor journals, then the preference is likely to be more for high impact factor journal."
,"The quality of the journal and its credibility, while important, are secondary to the content of the information cited. Sometimes newer disciplines and evolving ideas don't have very many established platforms on which they have been published on. It takes time for things to be absorbed, accepted and for a consensus to be reached on their importance. However, if it is relevant to your research, provides reasoned arguments backed by evidence or strong hypothesis, and has passed your own critical evaluation-- then by all means should you feel free to cite it. You are the best judge of your objectives, goals and intended outcomes."
,"The selection of key articles to cite in a publication occurs upstream of the writing of the work itself. It is made in determining the design of a study, which may not matter from what you know. Then you can switch to the experimental phase in an attempt to find something new and then publish it. Thus, the selection of citations is almost  forced ."

One should cite papers that influence the field most and/or  the formation of your paper most.
In reality, poeple tend to cite those their colleagues and friends, as that is convenient and also may get the paper cited too in return.

Articles from high quality/reputed journals should be used for citation. Article may be new or old but it should be relevant to the work. It is not possible to trust data published in predatory open access journals because some journals are not reviewed properly.
"
,"Scientific articles published in top peer reviewed journals should be used for citation.
while reviewing reviewer checks the paper citation which should be complete in all respects.
even if a scientific paper published in low impact factor journal should be carefully considered based on the review requirement and in depth results and discussions.
you may get a very good back reference from all these papers.
one thing is sure you must reach from old to current literature up to 2014

,Thanks Mahfuz and Tia for such a comprehensive answer with plausible explanation to understand the rule of thumb for citing any article while preparing a manuscript. In addition to the comments already made by the learned expert I would like to mention that it is always a good practice to cite the original article or the author (for credit) where the relevant study was reported and published for the first time (irrespective of the quality and impact of the journal) rather citing a cross reference for the same

"How stable are the components of BG-11 growth medium?
Hi there,
I am working with algae biomass cultivation and I use BG-11 as the growth medium. I wanted to ask, if the stock solutions used for the medium preparation can be stored in a refrigerator for extended time period? Are all of those solutions stable?
The thing is that last time I prepared my medium, I used stock solutions from the previous preparation. As a result I got medium with elevated pH (8.4) and after autoclaving it, there were some precipitate present in the flask.
Could anybody share their experience regarding this problem?
","BG-11 is rich with phosphates. They precipitate with Ca2+ and Mg2+, at least. I would suggest to use so called  cold  sterilization of the stock solution using a membrane filters with pores around 0.22 um. Do not postpone that longer than 1-2 days. Some microbes feel them self well in a fridge. You can autoclave water and mix it with cold-sterilized stock solution in any proportion. That will prevent the generation of a precipitate along with minimal changes of pH because hot sterilization stimulates the escape of CO2 from the newly prepared medium. Good luck!
"
,"Hello sir..
               I cannot comment on the different ingredients of the medium and its individual stability, but yes I have definitely used the ready-made preparation of the medium by Hi-Media and it really works well.
Regards and best wishes.

Since  the BG mediumroutnely autoclaved, I think it is stable.tl

We commonly keep phosphate, ferric ammonium citrate and carbonate separate from the other components.  One can either mix everything together before autoclaving (however, expect precipitates; not a biggie assuming you mix it right before you use it) or autoclave BG-11 (-P, Fe, CO3) and P, Fe and CO3 separately.
